RMV-Garantie-Tracker
====================

This is the email updates tracker for the applications of late/missed/cancelled
connections provided by [RMV public transport association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund).

RMV will send 2 emails regarding an application: one on submission, and one on
decision(approval/denial). Since the processing time varies, it's difficult to
track all submissions by hand. This tool will read the emails and tell you:

1. Which applications you have filed;
2. What are their status;
3. How much refunds are available;
4. And the due time (the deadline before which you can pick up the money).
